MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

Migration changes from 4.1.x to 4.2
MULE-15586: `lookup` function in DataWeave now has a timeout. The timeout for a specific lookup call may be increased by providing the new value with a third parameter (i.e.: lookup(vars.flow, payload, 10000).

Migration changes from 4.1.3 to 4.1.4
MULE-14148: HTTP wire logging now depends on the server/client names to allow more fine grained logging.
For example, given an HTTP listener config named "A" and an HTTP request config named "B", "HttpMessageLogger.A" will show only the listener data while "HttpMessageLogger.http.requester.B" will only show the requester data.
This means log lines will also feature the server/client naming convention.

Migration changes from 4.1.2 to 4.1.3
MULE-15167: a new property "mule.deploy.applications" was added to deploy specific applications on startup time. Old command line option "-app" is still functional but deprecated.

Migration changes from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
MULE-14910: logged event ID will not be formatted anymore. Replace "%X{correlationId}" by "[event: %X{correlationId}]" in log config files to keep behavior.
MULE-14962: increased default value for fixed-frequency component to 1 minute. Add 'frequency="1000"' to keep behavior (e.g. '<fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>').
