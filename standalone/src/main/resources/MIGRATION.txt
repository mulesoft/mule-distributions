MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

Migration changes from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
MULE-14910: logged event ID will not be formatted anymore. Replace "%X{correlationId}" by "[event: %X{correlationId}]" in log config files to keep behavior.
MULE-14962: increased default value for fixed-frequency component. Add 'frequency="1000"' to keep behavior (e.g. '<fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>').
